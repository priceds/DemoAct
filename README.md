This was class assignment for me & i was stuck at combining data from first two activities and send it to third
# how do i achieved it
i searched for possible solution for string data but none was available & then it clicked it to me , i created two string variable in
second activity and retrieved string from first activity to string1 & in string2 i fetched from EditText Control from current i.e. SecondActivity &
i created single string  string3 where i put string1  & string together with space in between & then send string3 to activity3 & it worked..
